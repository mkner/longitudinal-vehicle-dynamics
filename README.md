# vehicle-longitudinal-dynamics


This tutorial notebook is a model for automotive longitudinal physics and dynamics. 

Includes test scenarios for various 2-dimensional terrain and throttle profiles.

The reduction to 2D makes it easier to concentrate on the longitudinal dynamics 
and not be side-tracked with the kinematics of lateral motion.

The object oriented vehicle model expresses dynamics as an equation of forward
and opposing forces that would be typical necessary for a vehicle in motion. Characteristic
parameters of the automobile model are set. A basic terrain geometry and motion profile is
defined. Euler time-step integration yields acelleration, velocity and longitudinal 
position over time.
