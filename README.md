# vehicle-longitudinal-dynamics

This tutorial notebook is a model for automotive longitudinal physics and dynamics. 

Includes test scenarios for various 2-dimensional terrain and throttle profiles.
The reduction to 2D makes it easier to concentrate on the longitudinal dynamics 
and not be side-tracked with the kinematics of lateral motion.
